In terms of [John Baillieul]'s recent research, we developed a new navigation algorithm using [optical flow]. We assume if a vehicle is moving in a straight line and some feature points lie somewhere ahead of the vehicleâ€”possibly to the left or right in the environment, we can calculate the time-to-transit to those features. Then get the mean of time-to-transit in the left half frame and in the right half frame. In the final, we can use a rotation rate(k) to control the rotation.
